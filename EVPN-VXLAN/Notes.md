## VxLAN 
- What is VxLAN ?
VXLAN stands for virtual extensible LAN and is a protocol that allows tunneling of L2 frames on top of L3 networks. VXLAN is to DC what MPLS is to Service providers. In traditional networks when we want hosts in the same VLAN to communicate through different devices we have to extend the VLAN between devices using trunks. In modern large scale networks we removed Layer 2 from the access or leaf layer to avoid Spanning tree blocking links thus underutilizing all available bandwidth and not being able to load balance traffic across all available paths. The issue is that we still have to support applications that require to be in the same L2 domain, due to that we needed a way to carry L2 information over L3. One other issue is that for traditional VLANs there are only 12 bits reserved which result in 4096 - 2 (reserved) = 4094 usable VLANs, this is way too low for our modern application usage which could require hundreds of thousands of VLANs, VXLAN on the flipside has 24 bits reserved for the VNI (VXLAN Network identifier , similar to the VLAN ID) which gives us 16777215 Vxlan segments meeting the requirement for large scale application usage. As often the solution resides in **Encapsulation**. How it works is that
