# What To Study For Network Engineering Interviews With Big Tech

Hello everyone,

I have been thinking of creating this since a while, the motivator was that everytime I would want to start studying for interviews, I would know which topics to study but would never study the same material. I wanted to aggregate all the topics to study in one place to avoid the churn of finding relevant study material everytime and to have something personalized. At the same time I want to make it public to hold myself accountable and to share with the community, there is not much material on how to prepare network engineering interviews with big tech companies on the contrary of the software engineering world where they even have books, i.e. "Cracking the coding interview". This is a living repository that will grow with my skills and understanding of the industry. Thanks for passing by !
